[Codebenders][codebenders] is the prgramming club of IGDTUW. We aim at providing a platform for competitive programming under CodeChef, and encourage and promote women in the field of technology.

Here we will be posting about everything technical - from coding errors to smart practices as well as the so-called `how to` posts. If you wish to contribute in the form of blog post(s) or make suggestions, you can get in touch with us via one of social networking sites or drop us an email at _igdtuwcodebenders@gmail.com_.
For updates, stay tuned. Happy Coding!
