According to a survey, there were close to two billion Android powered devices in 2016, and this number will only increase. For more than two hundred million Indians, Android is the primary platform for consumption of content. 
From social and communication apps like Whatsapp, Instagram and Snapchat to utilities like Uber, Swiggy and Paytm - Android is the platform that enables companies to cater to their users 24x7.

This emerging field of computer science is easy and very interesting to learn (contrary to belief!).  There are various sources available on the internet to learn android but the one provided by Google is the most frequently used. You can find it [here](https://developer.android.com/training/index.html).

It explains all the topics from scratch with code samples that you can test and use in your apps as well. According to your level of understanding and comfort, the entire curriculum is divided into various classes starting from very basic to all the advanced functionalities available in android. The panel on the left gives you options to build apps ranging from the most basic ‘Hello World’ app to apps using the Google Maps API.
